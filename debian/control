Description: Easing functions for smooth animation
 Easing is a method of distorting time to control apparent motion in animation.
 It is most commonly used for slow-in, slow-out. By easing time, animated
 transitions are smoother and exhibit more plausible motion.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
